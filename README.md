# Exploratory Data Analysis 

The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) section is organized into multiple notebooks, each demonstrating different techniques for analyzing and visualizing data. These examples include basic descriptive statistics, handling missing data, detecting outliers, and visualizing relationships between variables through various plots. Each notebook provides a unique approach to EDA, showcasing how different methods can be applied depending on the dataset's characteristics and the analysis goals.
